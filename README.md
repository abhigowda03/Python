# Python Calculator

## Description

This project is a simple Python-based calculator application, built to perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It is designed to run on an online Python compiler or local Python environment.

The application prompts the user to input two numbers and an operator to perform a mathematical operation. The calculator supports the following operations:

- Addition (`+`)
- Subtraction (`-`)
- Multiplication (`*`)
- Division (`/`)

Additionally, the program includes error handling to ensure that the inputs are valid integers, and it provides helpful prompts for users to understand the available functions.

## Features

- User-friendly interface with prompts for entering numbers and operations.
- Handles invalid input gracefully by prompting the user again.
- Option to perform multiple calculations in a session.
- Includes a help option that displays available operations.
- Supports basic arithmetic operations: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division.
- Repeats the calculator after each calculation if the user desires.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/abhigowda03/Python.git
    ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd python-calculator
    ```

3. Ensure you have Python installed on your machine. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

4. Run the Python script:
    ```bash
    python calculator.py
    ```

## Usage

Once the script is executed, the user will be prompted with the following options:

1. Enter two numbers to perform the calculation.
2. Choose an operation: multiplication (`*`), division (`/`), addition (`+`), or subtraction (`-`).
3. Option to perform the operation again or exit after the result.

**Help Option**: You can type `HELP` to see a description of the available operations.

Example Output:

```text
